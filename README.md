# [Memory Game Project](https://donjosef.github.io/memory-project/)

This is a browser-based memory game

## How the game works

* The user clicks on one card to flip it and reveal its underlying symbol
* The user flips another card trying to match the previous one
* If the cards match then the cards stay flipped over
* If the cards dont match then the cards become hidden again
* The game ends when the user match every card on the grid
